Precompiles scalate templates. 
==============================

Mostly based on code from Yasushi Abe's http://github.com/Yasushi/scalate-cli and
github.com/Yasushi/sbt-scalate-plugin/ which were not working for me.

I trimmed ( probably with ill effects ) some code and plan to add some features.

I am using it to deploy scalate templates to GAE/J

Pending work 
------------

* BUG Generates code into mainSources triggering compilation twice when using ~ compile or similar.  This was my original problem ( original code entered into a loop ).

* Replace separators with correct platform independent separators.
